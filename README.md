# famark-cloud-api-cpp-example
This is a sample code showing how to call Famark Cloud API to store and retrieve data through C++ programming language.

*Note:* When using *Visual Studio Code* on Windows this sample uses cl.exe, that requires launching Visual Studio Code from **Developer Command Prompt for VS** so that the required environment variables are setup for compiling the cpp code.

### Setup Steps:
1. This example requires **Famark Cloud Instance**, you can [register free instance](https://www.famark.com/Install/?ic=FreeDev) or sign in to your [existing instance](https://www.famark.com/).
2. This example performs *Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete (CRUD)* actions on *Contact* entity present in *Business Solution*, so make sure you have the Business solution installed in your instance, if not then goto:-  
*`Solutions > more actions (...) > Import Solution > Import From Store > Business Solution Install > Import Solution`*
3. Clone this repository, build and run the code to perform CRUD actions on Contact entity.

*You can modify the code to perform CRUD operations on your own entities.*
